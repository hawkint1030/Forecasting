This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

```{r setup, echo=FALSE}
rm(list=ls())
library(fpp2)
```

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explore how we can manually decompose and additive time series data.

## Data
We will be using the elec data for this analysis.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
autoplot(elec)
```

## Procedure for decomposing the series

**Step 1: Detect the trend using a centered Moving Average**
```{r}
Trend <- ma(elec, order = 12, centre = TRUE)
autoplot(cbind(elec,Trend),facets = TRUE)
```

**Step 2: Detrend the Series**

```{r}
elec_detrend <- elec - Trend
autoplot(elec_detrend)
```

**Step 3: Get the average seasonlity across time.**

Easy way:
(i) Drop NA's and get the seasonal averages using a loop
```{r}
avg <- NULL

for (i in 1:12){
avg[i] <- mean(subset(elec_detrend,month = i),na.rm = TRUE)
}
avg
```

(ii) Replicate the Averages to match the number of years of the original data
```{r}
Seasonal <- ts(rep(avg,40), start=c(1956,1), frequency = 12)
```

(iii) Recall that we lost the first and last 6 observations to the centered MA so we will set them to NAs
```{r}
Seasonal[1:6] <- NA -> Seasonal[(length(Seasonal)-5):length(Seasonal)]
# Notice that I am able to assign the NA to two things at once

autoplot(Seasonal) 
```

**Step 4: Get the Remainder Component**

$$Y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t \Longrightarrow Y_t - S_t - T_t = R_t$$
```{r}
Remainder. <- elec - Trend - Seasonal

autoplot(Remainder.)
```

## Model Comparisions

Now we can finish by ploting all the components together
```{r, fig.align= "center"}
# Manually:
g1 <- autoplot(cbind(elec,Trend,Seasonal, Remainder.), facets = TRUE) + ylab("")
# Using the Package: 
g2 <- autoplot(stl(elec,s.window = "periodic")) 
gridExtra::grid.arrange(g1,g2, ncol=2)
```
