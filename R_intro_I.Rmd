# `R` Introduction

## Roadmap

1. What is `R`?
2. Why `R`? Three useful features
3. Why R studio?
4. A Short Tour of R Studio
5. Script file

## What is `R`? Why `R`?
### What is `R`?
`R` is a **programming language** used for statistical analysis and graphics. It is based on S-plus, which itself was based on S, a programming language originally developed by AT&T. 

### Why `R`?

- Open source, cross-platform, and **free**
- Great for reproducibility
- Interdisciplinary and extensible
- Tons of learning resources
- Works on data of all shapes and sizes
- Produces high-quality graphics
- Large and welcoming community


## `R`: Object-Oriented Programming

Unlike many other statistical softwares such as SAS and SPSS, `R` will not spit out a mountain of output on the screen. 

Instead, `R` returns an **object** containing all the results. You, as an user, have the flexibility to choose which result to be extracted or reported.


## `R`: Functional Programming

This feature allows us to write faster yet more compact code. For example, a common theme in `R` programming is **avoidance of explicit iteration**. Unlike many other statistical softwares, explicit loops are discouraged.


Instead, `R` provides some functions that could allow us to express iterative behavior implicitly.


## `R`: Polymorphic

`R` is also *polymorphic*, which means that a single function can be applied to different types of inputs (much more user friendly).

Such a function is called a *generic function* (If you are a C++ programmer, you have seen a similar concept in *virtual functions*).

## `R`: Polymorphic (Example)

Lets look at one example `plot()`

1. Plot a vector of numbers
2. Plot some model results

No matter which purpose, we use the same function. 

## `R`: Polymorphic (Example) {.plain}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.height=4}
data<-c(1,2,3,4)
plot(data)
```

## {.plain}

```{r, echo=TRUE, fig.show= "hold", fig.height=5}
# Regression Analysis
par(mfrow=c(2,2),mar=c(2,4,2,2))
results<-lm(speed ~ dist,data=cars)
plot(results)

```


## Why R Studio?

- `R` Interface is **ugly**!


- Many students in this class are much more familiar with Windows operation system and have never been exposed programming before, so we will use R studio, one of the free Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) that have been developed for `R`. 

    - R studio should really be considered as *integrated development environments* (IDEs), since it is aimed more toward programming.

- Easy publishing of reproducible documents such as reports, interactive visualizations, presentations, and websites.

## R Studio: A short tour {.plain}

**Initial Start**

When you first (like very first time) open R studio you will see three panels.


![](../images/rstudio-start.png){height=65%}


## R Studio: A short tour {.plain}

**Console**

![](../images/rstudio-console.png){height=80%}



---

**Console**

1. Everytime you launch RStudio, it will have the same text at the top of the console telling you the version of R that you're running.
2. Below that information is the prompt, > . As its name suggests, this prompt is really a request, a request for a command.
3. Initially, interacting with R is all about typing commands and interpreting the output.
4. These commands and their syntax have evolved over decades (literally) and now provide what many users feel is a fairly natural way to access data and organize, describe, and invoke statistical computations.

\bigskip

The console is where you type commands and have them immediately performed.



## R Studio: A short tour {.plain}

**Environment** The panel in the upper right contains your workspace (aka Environment)

![](../images/rstudio-env.png){width=80%}

1. This shows you a list of objects/variables that R has saved.
2. For example here a value of 3 has been assigned to the object a.



## R Studio: A short tour {.plain}

**History** Up here there is an additional tab to see the history of the commands that you've previously entered.



![](../images/rstudio-history.png)


## R Studio: A short tour {.plain}

**Files** The files tab allows you to open code/script files within R studio.


![](../images/rstudio-files.png)

## R Studio: A short tour

**Plots** Any plots that you generate will show up in the panel in the lower right corner.


![](../images/rstudio-plot.png)


## R Studio: A short tour

**Help** To check the syntax of any function in R, type ? in front of the function name to pull up the help file.


![](../images/rstudio-help.png){width=80%}

For example here I typed ?mean to get the help file for the mean function. Admittedly these aren't the most helpful of files at times. 

---
**Script File** The top left is your editor window, where you write code or script, the console is now at the bottom. **I usually change it**

![](../images/rstudio-changed.png){width=80%}

The picture above illustrates my preferred style in R Studio.


## R Script

Most of `R` users typically submit commands to `R` by typing either in console or editor panel, rather than clicking a mouse in a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

**Script** is nothing but **a collection of commands**
\bigskip 

There are at least two advantages of doing so:

1. This allows us to run a bunch of results altogether by putting a collection of commands in a file (i.e., "script"). 
2. It is also a lot more transparent and straightforward to **share** and **replicate** what you have done.

\bigskip

**In our class, you will do this!**

## R Script {.plain}

**Task 1:** Create a script file

1. Open R Studio and go to File > New > R Script. This will open a blank text document.\footnote{\tiny{Two alternative ways are: \textbf{CTRL + SHIFT + N} or press the button marked "+", just below File, and select R Script}} 

2. In the document, type


```{r, eval=FALSE}
x = 5  # Assign the variable x a value of 5
x == 5  # Does x = 5? Notice the double ==
```

Highlight both lines of code and click the button marked "Run". If everything is working correctly, the console should display TRUE.

OR, pressing \textbf{CTRL + ENTER}  or \textbf{COMMAND + RETURN} depending on whether you're running Mac OSX, Linux or Windows.

3. go to "File > Save As", and choose a file name.
